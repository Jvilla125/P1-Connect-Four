# Connect Four
Connect four is a two-player game in which each player has their own colored chip and takes turns dropping their chip into the first available row of the 6x7 grid. 

The objective of the game is for a player to get four consecutive same colored chips (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). 

# Screenshots of the Game 

* The start screen of the game will ask the user to press the **`"Press to Start Game"`** button to start the game.

* If none of the players are able to get four-in-a-row and use all of their chips, the game will result into a **`Draw`**.

# Wireframing 

I used the `Whimsical` website to help plan out what the design of the game will look like at each step. In the images below, you can see the game from start to finish.

# Getting Started

_**[Click this link to play!](https://jvilla125.github.io/P1-Connect-Four/)**_

When the website loads, please press the **`"Press to Start Game"`** to start the game. 

1. The first player will be `Player 1` and will have the `blue` chip.
2. The second player will be `Player 1` and will have the `red` chip. 
3. Each player will get `one click` for their turn before it switches to the next player. 

* _**An important note:**_ Please click exactly where you want to place your chip on the grid. (It will not drop down to the spot you want if you are clicking near the top of the grid. )

# Next Steps
On the next update of my game I am planning on including the following features:

1. Add a hover feature that will automatically drop a chip to the first available row. 
2. Update the UI design to be more customized with a theme.
3. Incoporate a score tracker to show how many times a player has won.
4. Include a reset button.
